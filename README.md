# Lost_in_the_Woods

This application will allow the player to feel the terror of being lost in haunted woods at night.

The goal of this project was to put together all of the knowledge acquired in the Udacity Nanodegree program, and create a app that evokes some kind of emotion. The emotion I chose was "fear."
